/**
 * When an element is located using "ng-repeat", the the locator is known as "repeater" and is provided as 
 * shown below:
 * 	element(By.repeat("repeat_value"));
 * When you provide the above statement, the scope of element finding will be confined to the section of the
 * element having "ng-repeat" attribute only and not on the enteire page.
 * 
 * As a result, if there are multiple elements on the page, that has, let's say the same css locator value,
 * then using this way, we can locate that specific element that is specific (or a child) of the repeater 
 * locator only and not related to the entiere page
 * 
 * Thus, in such cases, repeater locator can be used efficiently.
